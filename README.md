# Terrorism_dataset_EDA

## Problem Statement:
Global Terrorism Dataset (GTD) is a comprehensive, open-source database that provides information on terrorist incidents worldwide from 1970 to 2017. The database is maintained and updated by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) based at the University of Maryland. The GTD contains information on over 180,000 terrorist incidents, making it one of the largest and most widely used terrorism databases in the world.

## What I did:
The exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the GTD showed that terrorism has become increasingly widespread and complex over the past several decades. The number of incidents and fatalities has increased steadily since the 1970s, with the majority of incidents taking place in the Middle East and South Asia. The most common type of attack was found to be bombings and explosions, which accounted for nearly 60% of all incidents.

The analysis also revealed that the majority of terrorist incidents were carried out by extremist groups with political or ideological motivations, such as ISIL and the Taliban. These groups have been responsible for a large number of high-casualty attacks.

Geographic analysis of the GTD showed that the frequency and intensity of terrorism vary widely between countries and regions. Some countries, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, have experienced extremely high levels of terrorism in recent years, while others have been largely unaffected. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific local, regional, and global factors that contribute to the emergence and spread of terrorism.

The EDA of the GTD also revealed that terrorism is a complex and evolving phenomenon that is difficult to predict and prevent. While the number of incidents and fatalities has increased over time, the types of attacks and responsible groups have also changed. This highlights the need for continued research and analysis of the GTD in order to better understand the nature and dynamics of terrorism and to develop effective responses to it.

Overall, the EDA of the Global Terrorism Dataset provides valuable insights into the trends and patterns of terrorism around the world. By analyzing this rich and comprehensive dataset, researchers, policymakers, and law enforcement officials can gain a deeper understanding of the nature and scope of terrorism and develop effective responses to it.
